                'review': "As a long-time fan of the Counter-Strike series, it pains me to say this — but CS2 is a massive disappointment.\r\n\r\nTerrible matchmaking – Even in casual games, the matchmaking is completely unbalanced. There's no sense of fair competition, and the ranking system feels meaningless.\r\n\r\nNo real anti-cheat – The cheating problem is out of control. Even in casual matches, cheaters are everywhere. Wallhacks, aimbots — you name it. It ruins the experience entirely.\r\n\r\nThe game is unplayable because of cheaters – Right now, as I write this review, there’s a cheater on the enemy team blatantly walling, seeing us through walls and pre-aiming every move. How is this acceptable?\r\n\r\nWith frustration and disappointment, I’ve uninstalled CS2. Until Valve takes cheating seriously and implements a proper anti-cheat system, I won’t be coming back.\r\n\r\n",

                'review': "It was the late '90s, a time when the internet still buzzed with the sound of dial-up modems and cybercafés were sacred temples for young gamers. That’s where I first discovered Counter-Strike. Back then, it was just a Half-Life mod — a simple idea: terrorists vs. counter-terrorists. But for me, and for many from my generation, Counter-Strike was much more than that.\n\nI remember my first matches on maps like de_dust and cs_assault. Games full of adrenaline, improvised strategies, and shouting between friends whenever someone pulled off an epic play… or died in the dumbest way. But it was also in those servers where I met the people who, without realizing it at the time, would become my best friends.\n\nAs time passed, we grew up. We studied, worked, moved away, some of us became parents. I now have several kids, responsibilities, a life that no longer revolves around spending afternoons at a LAN café. But one thing hasn’t changed: I still play Counter-Strike. Not every day, of course. Sometimes once a month, maybe twice. But always with the same friends. We log in, even if it’s just for an hour, and we’re back to being those kids from the 2000s — yelling through our headsets, laughing at silly moments, and coming up with absurd strategies that never actually work.\n\nThe most beautiful part is that now my kids watch me play, asking about that “old game” I like so much. Some of them have even started playing it too. I tell them that thanks to Counter-Strike, I have my best friends. That it was more than a game; it was a bridge between eras, a bond that’s lasted decades, a space where we’re still ourselves, no matter how much our lives change.\n\nCounter-Strike didn’t just define a gaming era — it defined a part of my life. And as long as I can lift a mouse and hit the “buy AK-47” key, I’ll be there, in the server with my lifelong friends. Because some matches, simply, never end.",

The tactical depth, the adrenaline of clutch moments, and the teamwork make it unmatched—but cheaters are ruining it.\n\nThe Good:\n✅ Addictive gameplay – No two matches feel the same.\n✅ High skill ceiling – Rewards practice and strategy.\n✅ Community (when it’s good) – Playing with friends is a blast.\n\nThe Bad:\n❌ Cheaters everywhere – Obvious wallhacks, aimbots, and smurfs destroy fair matches.\n❌ VAC is too slow – Reporting feels useless when cheaters roam free for weeks.\n❌ Toxic vibes – Sexist/racist comments (yes, even in 2024) make it worse.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nCS2 is still a masterpiece, but Valve needs to:\n\nFix anti-cheat (why not hardware bans?).\n\nPunish smurfs in ranked.\n\nEncourage positivity (better moderation?).\n\nI’ll keep playing—but only with my trusted squad. If you can tolerate the flaws, CS2 remains the FPS king. 6/10 for solo queue, 9/10 with friends.\n\nExtra Notes (Casual Rant Mode):\n"Why do cheaters even play? Go touch grass!" 🌿\n\n"To the non-toxic randoms: You’re the real MVPs." 💙\n\n"Valve, I beg you—give us girl gamers a better experience!" 😭',

Since im a new player, I somehow have insta-red trust factor (or at least thats what my research says), so not only does it take 20 minutes of queuing to find a game, but when I do find a game 100% chance of a hacker being in it and ruining it.\n\nTried purchasing prime but that made it even worse.\n\nGame is currently unplayable. I spend more time queuing than playing.\n\nGot a notification "You\'ve played an extra 10 hours, would you like to update your review?"\n\nYeah it\'s even worse...',

                'review': 'Counter-Strike 2 brings a fresh coat of paint to a legendary game, with upgraded visuals, smoother movement, and new smoke mechanics that add a tactical twist to classic gameplay. While it’s a solid evolution with improved responsiveness thanks to tickless servers, it still feels like a work in progress—missing some maps and features from CS:GO, and occasionally plagued by bugs or matchmaking issues. That said, it’s a strong foundation for the future of CS, and fans should be excited for what’s to come.',

There is little-to-no strategy in anything under 10k, other that strafe headshots. \nMatchmaking is scuffed, and I would reckon a hardcore cheater 50% of the time, and soft cheats used more frequently. \nThey don't implement anti-cheat because cheaters buy skins and make them money, plain and simple. Yet we all keep going back. \nNot to mention the culture is absolutely abhorrent. Death threats and threats of violence, I have been DDoS'd, my personal information has been accessed... 2000+ hours and only 1 person I have reported has been banned. And I'm still gonna play after this review... This phenomenon needs to be studied.",

But through a display of great tenacity, the likes of which have rarely been seen in history, I resisted. The whole way playing through the game, I was disgusted, revolted by the sheer amount of repugnant garbage in this game. Yet I persevered, because this review had to be finished. This game took days to finish, because I could only bear the excessive amount of sheer, unadulterated garbage for so long. Whenever I got tired of this stupid, rubbish game, I'd put it in a radiation cabinet. It was so garbage it needed to be stored in a special container so that it couldn't contaminate my other possessions. Eventually, it got to my head just how rubbish the game was, I started to cry while playing it because the mental fortitude one must possess to get through this game is not the kind I possess. Once the suffering was over, I immediately put on latex gloves and a welding helmet, because this game should never be seen or touched by anyone. I put the game in a garbage bag, dug a hole in the ground and threw the game down, never to be seen again. I beg of the developers of this game to please, PLEASE make better games in the future because no human being should ever be made to sit through this game.",

It’s extremely disheartening to invest time in a competitive game mode like Premier, only to encounter obvious cheaters with no consequences. At this point, it feels like using cheats has become a requirement to stay competitive, which is unacceptable.\n\nThe lack of visible moderation or effective anti-cheat measures has resulted in a very poor and frustrating experience for legitimate players. I sincerely hope Valve takes this issue seriously and commits to improving VAC and its enforcement systems.\n\nThank you for your attention.',

Of course, there are quite a few cheaters in the regular matchmaking, but for me, the solution has been playing on FACEIT. There are fewer cheaters, even fewer smurfs, and when someone is caught smurfing, they actually get banned. Overall, it's a great game, but it’s definitely better when played on FACEIT.",

The graphics and lighting are much improved, the gunplay feels smooth and responsive, and the new features add a fresh twist to the familiar gameplay. However, there are still some performance issues and occasional bugs that need fixing. Despite that, it's a fun and competitive experience, especially with friends. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed CS:GO or wants to try a fast-paced tactical shooter.\r\n\r\n",
